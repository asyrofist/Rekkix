 * \brief Simple and small factory used to instantiate the adequate implementation of RequirementFileAbstract
 *
 * Once Rekkix has parsed the configuration file, it is able to instantiate the adequate file parsers
 * for each configured file according to its file extension.
 *
 * Available parser are :
 * - docx : parse the file as a MS Word file
 * - odt : parse the file as a LibreOffice text file
 * - txt : parse the file as a plain text file
 * - pdf : parse the file as a pdf file
