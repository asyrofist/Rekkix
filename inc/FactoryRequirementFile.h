 * Once Rekkix has parsed the configuration file, it is able to instantiate the adequate file parsers
 * for each configured file according to its file extension.
 *
 * TODO Using QSetting, Rekkix should know which extension must trigger the use of which parser
 *      (for example, *.txt or *.tex or *.cpp files will use the same "plain text" parser)
